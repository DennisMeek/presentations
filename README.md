## About Me
I'm Dennis Meek; I entered the world of Information Technology world out of college working for Accenture and Freemarkets.com. 

After Ariba acquired Freemarkets, I found myself without a job and through the kindness of a friend I ended up working in the Consumer Packaged Goods industry. However, I never lost my love for technology and have tried to inject cultural change by transforming each job into a data-driven and value-focused role. The CPG industry a heavy user of Excel and I can say that the resistance to change over the years was a relatively high, yet little by little I've always been able to win over converts.

I am a firm believer in mentoring and helping others. Frankly, when I die no one will remember how much stuff I sold, the code I wrote, or any myriad of other things. However, people will care and remember if I invested in others. This repository is part of my efforts to invest in others. 

## Why Python?

I switched industries in 2016 from CPG to a B2B company that deals with building care, disinfection, and other maintenance type functions. If the CPG industry runs on a Big Chief tablet and pencil, the B2B chemicals world is chiseling stone. Initially, I built a CRM/analytics prototype using FileMaker Pro and later realized that it felt more like a prison than a scalable solution. I still use it today, but it never fully addressed my needs. 

In a weird twist of fate, I opened an email for a humble bundle of five Python books for $15, and it is the best bizarre email I have ever opened. As I worked through "Automating the Boring Stuff with Python" and "Crash Course in Python" a whole new world opened up for me, and I've never looked back.

## What's in this Repository

The contents are primarily Python focused presentations and other materials that I hope will be helpful to anyone trying to learn Python. 

The presentation titled, "Python for Beginners" is my first formal Python presentation and focuses on why I learned Python and the twelve things I wish I had known when I started. 

I genuinely believe the best way to learn anything is to do so with an attitude of reteaching it to others. In the Army, we called it "see one, do one, teach one,"  and the process is beneficial. 

Additionally, I am adding in architecture slides related to topics such as building a data science workflow/framework using Docker and other tools.

At it the core, this is a journal of my journey, a journal I hope will help others.
