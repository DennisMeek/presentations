# Presentations

## About Me
I'm Dennis Meek, I starting out in the IT world working for Accenture and Freemarkets.com. 

After Freemarkets was acquired by Ariba, I found myself without a job and through the kindness of a friend I ended up working in the Consumer Packaged Goods work. However, I never lost my love for technology and have tried to inject cultural change by transforming each job into a data-driven and value focused role. The road has not been easier, yet little by little I've always been able to win over converts.



## What's in this Repository

I started by rolling up 
Additionnally, I adding in arcitecture slides related to topics such as building a data science work flow / framework using Docker and other tools.
